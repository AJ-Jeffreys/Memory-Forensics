# 🧠 Memory Forensics Case: Slow Computer (Windows 10)

---

## 📄 Case Summary

This forensic investigation was performed on a Windows 10 system reported as "slow." I used Volatility 3 to analyze a captured memory image, looking for signs of malware, process injection, LOLBins, or misbehaving software.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Volatility 3**
  - Plugins: `pslist`, `cmdline`, `malfind`, `dlllist`, `netscan`
- **YARA**
- **strings**, **CyberChef**, **VirusTotal**

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- 🟡 `rundll32.exe` with no command-line arguments (T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution)
- 🔴 Injected shellcode in memory (`malfind`) under `explorer.exe` (T1055 - Process Injection)
- 🔵 Obfuscated DLL with no digital signature (T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information)

| ID     | Technique                          | Description                        |
|--------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| T1055  | Process Injection                  | Malicious shellcode in explorer.exe |
| T1218  | Signed Binary Proxy Execution      | rundll32.exe misuse                |
| T1027  | Obfuscated Files or Information    | Unsigned and suspicious DLL        |
| T1059  | Command and Scripting Interpreter  | PowerShell abuse suspected         |

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Always check the parent-child relationships (`pslist`)
- Combine `cmdline` and `malfind` for detection of LOLBins
- Dumping memory tells the real story — way beyond logs or AV
